# Discord Moderation Bot

A full-featured Discord moderation bot built with **discord.js v14**. Supports multiple servers, with per-server configuration managed via `/setup` slash commands. Includes moderation commands, auto-moderation, and comprehensive logging.

---

## Features

### Slash Commands
| Command | Description | Permission Required |
|---|---|---|
| `/ban` | Ban a member (with optional message deletion) | Ban Members |
| `/kick` | Kick a member | Kick Members |
| `/mute` | Timeout a member (1 min – 7 days) | Moderate Members |
| `/unmute` | Remove a timeout | Moderate Members |
| `/warn` | Issue a warning (stored persistently) | Moderate Members |
| `/warnings` | View or clear a member's warnings | Moderate Members |
| `/purge` | Bulk delete up to 100 messages (optional: filter by user; skips messages older than 14 days) | Manage Messages |
| `/setup` | Configure the bot for this server | Administrator |

### `/setup` Subcommands
| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `/setup log-channel` | Set the channel where mod-log messages are sent |
| `/setup add-bad-words` | Add words to this server's banned list (on top of the global list) |
| `/setup clear-bad-words` | Remove all server-specific banned words (global list unchanged) |
| `/setup view-bad-words` | Show global and server-specific banned word lists separately |
| `/setup block-links` | Enable or disable link blocking for this server |
| `/setup spam-threshold` | Set how many messages in 5 seconds triggers spam detection |
| `/setup view` | Show the full current configuration for this server |

### Auto-Moderation
- **Bad word filter** — Deletes messages containing words from the global list or the server's extra list. Matching is evasion-resistant:
  - Leet-speak normalization (`@` → `a`, `3` → `e`, `$` → `s`, `ph` → `f`, etc.)
  - Diacritic stripping (`fück` → `fuck`, `slür` → `slur`)
  - Zero-width / invisible Unicode removal (common copy-paste evasion)
  - Fuzzy symbol substitution (`f*ck`, `f.u.c.k`, `h-a-t-e` all match)
- **Link blocker** — Optionally blocks all HTTP/HTTPS URLs (per server)
- **Spam detection** — Mutes users who send too many messages too fast; escalating timeouts (1 min, 5 min, 1 hour)
- **Moderator bypass** — Members with the `Manage Messages` permission are exempt from all auto-mod checks

### Logging (to your configured `#mod-log` channel)
- Member joins (flags accounts less than 7 days old)
- Member leaves (shows roles held)
- Message edits (before/after)
- Message deletes
- All moderation actions (ban, kick, mute, warn, auto-mod, purge)

## Setup Guide

### Step 1 — Create a Discord Application & Bot

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application**, give it a name, and click **Create**
3. Go to the **Bot** tab on the left sidebar
4. Click **Add Bot** → **Yes, do it!**
5. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - **Server Members Intent**
   - **Message Content Intent**
6. Click **Save Changes**
7. Click **Reset Token** and copy your **Bot Token** — save it for later

### Step 2 — Invite the Bot to Your Server(s)

1. Go to the **OAuth2 → URL Generator** tab
2. Under **Scopes**, check: `bot` and `applications.commands`
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, check:
   - `Ban Members`
   - `Kick Members`
   - `Moderate Members` (for timeouts)
   - `Manage Messages`
   - `Send Messages`
   - `Embed Links`
   - `Read Message History`
   - `View Channels`
4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot
5. Repeat for each additional server

### Step 3 — Get Your Client ID

Enable **Developer Mode** in Discord:
> User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode → ON

Then find your **Client ID** on the Discord Developer Portal under your App → OAuth2.

### Step 4 — Install & Configure

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the two required values:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
```

The remaining variables are optional global defaults that apply to all servers. Per-server settings are configured with `/setup` after the bot starts (see Step 6).

```env
# Words banned in every server (server admins can add more with /setup add-bad-words)
BAD_WORDS=badword1,badword2,badword3

# Global defaults — can be overridden per server with /setup
BLOCK_LINKS=false
SPAM_THRESHOLD=5
```

### Step 5 — Register Slash Commands

Commands are deployed **globally** and will be available in every server the bot joins.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

You should see:
```
Registering 8 slash command(s) globally...
Slash commands registered globally. Changes may take up to 1 hour to appear in all servers.
```

> Global commands can take up to 1 hour to propagate after the first deploy. You only need to re-run this when you add or remove commands.

### Step 6 — Start the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
[CMD] Loaded: ban
[CMD] Loaded: kick
...
Logged in as YourBot#0000
```

### Step 7 — Configure Each Server

When the bot joins a server, it will automatically DM the server owner with setup instructions. You can also run these commands yourself at any time:

1. **Set a log channel** (required for logging to work):
   ```
   /setup log-channel #mod-log
   ```

2. **Add server-specific banned words** (optional — global words from `.env` are always active):
   ```
   /setup add-bad-words words:slur1,slur2
   ```

3. **Adjust other settings** as needed:
   ```
   /setup block-links enabled:true
   /setup spam-threshold amount:4
   ```

4. **Check your configuration** at any time:
   ```
   /setup view
   /setup view-bad-words
   ```

Per-server settings are saved to `data/guild-configs.json` on the host machine.

## Updating an Existing Installation

If the bot is already running in one or more servers and you are pulling the latest code, follow these steps. The `guildCreate` event only fires when the bot first joins a server — existing servers will not receive the automatic setup DM.

### Step 1 — Pull the latest code and install dependencies

```bash
git pull
npm install
```

### Step 2 — Update your `.env`

Remove `GUILD_ID` and `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` — they are no longer used. Keep everything else.

```env
BOT_TOKEN=...        # keep
CLIENT_ID=...        # keep
# GUILD_ID=...       # remove — no longer used
# LOG_CHANNEL_ID=... # remove — set per-server with /setup log-channel instead
BAD_WORDS=...        # keep — applies globally to all servers
BLOCK_LINKS=...      # keep — global default, can be overridden per server
SPAM_THRESHOLD=...   # keep — global default, can be overridden per server
```

### Step 3 — Re-deploy slash commands

This registers the new `/setup` command. Run it once while the bot is stopped.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

> Global commands can take up to 1 hour to appear in existing servers.

### Step 4 — Restart the bot

```bash
npm start
```

If you are using `pm2`:

```bash
pm2 restart all
```

### Step 5 — Restore the log channel in each server

All moderation commands continue to work immediately, but logging will be silent until you set a log channel. Run this in each server:

```
/setup log-channel #your-mod-log-channel
```

Your existing warning history in `data/warnings.json` carries over automatically — no action needed there.

## Important Notes

- **Never share your `.env` file** or commit it to Git. Add it to `.gitignore`.
- The bot needs a role **higher than the roles of users it moderates** in each server's role hierarchy.
- Warnings are stored in `data/warnings.json` — back this up if you want to preserve history.
- Per-server config is stored in `data/guild-configs.json` — include this in any backups.
